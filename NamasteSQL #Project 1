Analyzing Credit Card Spending Habits In India

---- Q1.) Write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends 
SELECT TOP 5 city, total_spend, concat(pct,'%')
FROM (SELECT  DISTINCT(city), 
SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY city) AS total_spend,

(SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY city)*100./SUM(amount) OVER ()) AS pct
FROM credit_card_transactions) a
ORDER BY total_spend DESC

---- Q2.) Write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type
WITH CTE_1 AS (SELECT card_type, DATENAME(MONTH,transaction_date) AS month, DATENAME(YEAR, transaction_date) AS year, SUM(amount) AS total_spend
FROM credit_card_transactions
GROUP BY card_type, DATENAME(MONTH,transaction_date), DATENAME(YEAR, transaction_date)),

	CTE_2 AS (SELECT *,
	RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY card_type ORDER BY total_spend DESC) AS RANK
	FROM CTE_1)
	
	SELECT card_type, month, year, total_spend 
	FROM CTE_2
	WHERE RANK = 1;

---- Q3.) Write a query to print the transaction details(all columns from the table) for each card type when
it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends(We should have 4 rows in the o/p one for each car
WITH CTE_1 AS (SELECT *,
SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY card_type ORDER BY transaction_date, transaction_id) AS cumulative_total
FROM credit_card_transactions),

	CTE_2 AS (SELECT *,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY card_type ORDER BY cumulative_total) AS tots
FROM CTE_1
WHERE cumulative_total >=1000000)

SELECT transaction_id, city, transaction_date, card_type, exp_type, gender, amount, cumulative_total
FROM CTE_2
WHERE tots = 1


---- Q4.) Write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type
WITH CTE_1 AS (SELECT city, SUM(amount) AS total_spend
FROM credit_card_transactions
GROUP BY city),


	CTE_2 AS (SELECT city, SUM(amount) AS gold_card_spend
FROM credit_card_transactions
WHERE card_type = 'Gold'
GROUP BY city)

SELECT TOP 1 ct.city, total_spend, gold_card_spend, gold_card_spend*100.0/total_spend AS gold_spend
FROM CTE_1 ct
INNER JOIN CTE_2 ctt
ON ct.city = ctt.city
ORDER BY gold_spend;

---- Q5.) Write a query to print 3 columns:  city, highest_expense_type , lowest_expense_type (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel)
WITH CTE_1 AS (SELECT *,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY max_spend DESC) AS RANK
FROM (SELECT *, 
SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY city, exp_type) AS max_spend
FROM credit_card_transactions)  a),


	CTE_2 AS (SELECT *,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY min_spend) AS RANK
FROM (SELECT *, 
SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY city, exp_type) AS min_spend
FROM credit_card_transactions)  a)

SELECT DISTINCT ct.city, ct.exp_type AS highest_expense_type, ctt.exp_type AS lowest_expense_type
FROM CTE_1 ct
INNER JOIN CTE_2 ctt
ON ct.city = ctt.city
WHERE ct.rank = 1 AND ctt.rank = 1
ORDER BY ct.city;

---- Q6.) Write a query to find percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type
SELECT DISTINCT exp_type, pct_contribution
FROM (SELECT *,
SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY exp_type, gender)*100.0/SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY exp_type) AS pct_contribution
FROM credit_card_transactions) a
WHERE gender = 'F';
